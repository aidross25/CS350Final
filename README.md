### Objective
The objective of this project is to compare how Ruby and Rust handle the concept of passing subprograms as parameters, focusing on syntax, implementation, and functionality.

### Project Scope
- **Languages Selected:** Ruby and Rust
- **Feature of Interest:** Passing subprograms as parameters
- **Deliverables:**
  - A comprehensive report comparing the two languages.
  - Full source code implementations.
  - Execution environments and screenshots of program outputs.
  - A presentation summarizing findings.

### Why Ruby and Rust?
- **Ruby:** A dynamic, object-oriented scripting language known for ease of use and flexibility.
- **Rust:** A systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and memory management.

### Key Comparison Points
1. **Syntax & Structure:** Examining how each language defines and passes functions.
2. **Usability & Readability:** Comparing the ease of implementation.
3. **Performance Considerations:** Discussing efficiency differences.
4. **Practical Applications:** Real-world scenarios where each approach shines.

### Expected Outcomes
- An understanding of how Ruby and Rust implement function passing.
- Insights into best practices for each language.
- Code samples demonstrating the feature in real-world contexts.

### Tools & Platforms
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Rust Compiler, Ruby Interpreter
- **Execution Environment:** Local machines and online compilers as needed.
