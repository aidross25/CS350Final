## Title: Parameters that are Subprograms - Ruby vs Rust
Unfortunately, because of the simplistic nature of the Scratch programming language, our topic is too complex to adequately portray the design characteristics of passing parameters that are subprograms. It can be achieved in Scratch, but for the purposes of academics, we decided to compare two programming languages commonly used by adults.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to compare how Ruby and Rust handle the concept of passing subprograms as parameters, focusing on syntax, implementation, and functionality.

### Project Scope
- **Languages Selected:** Ruby and Rust
- **Feature of Interest:** Passing subprograms as parameters
- **Deliverables:**
  - A comprehensive report comparing the two languages.
  - Full source code implementations.
  - Execution environments and screenshots of program outputs.
  - A presentation summarizing findings.

### Why Ruby and Rust?
- **Ruby:** A dynamic, object-oriented scripting language known for ease of use and flexibility.
- **Rust:** A systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and memory management.

### Key Comparison Points
1. **Syntax & Structure:** Examining how each language defines and passes functions.
2. **Usability & Readability:** Comparing the ease of implementation.
3. **Performance Considerations:** Discussing efficiency differences.
4. **Practical Applications:** Real-world scenarios where each approach shines.

### Expected Outcomes
- An understanding of how Ruby and Rust implement function passing.
- Insights into best practices for each language.
- Code samples demonstrating the feature in real-world contexts.

### Tools & Platforms
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Rust Compiler, Ruby Interpreter
- **Execution Environment:** Local machines and online compilers as needed.
